## Git Implementation in GO
This repository implements Git's basic features such as git init, status, add, commit, cat-file.

I stored raw data instead of encrypted. Therefore, It doesn't encrypt as Git. I could have done that way, however, I build it to learn Git internal. Still, I might jump into it in comming days. 

My Docs while building it: [Link](https://www.notion.so/Git-2b62dd934407804abc35f809d27d0740?source=copy_link)

## Features Implemented
- git init 
- git status
- git add . 
- git add file-path 
- git commit
- git log 
- git log --oneline
- git cat-file "hash"

The remaining features will be added in comming days.
